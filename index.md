I am a Kinesiology major at CSUF and will be graduating this Spring semester.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 1, was one of my favorite labs because I had never been introduced to anything related to computer science. This lab allowed me to code for the first time and was a motivator for me. Being a beginner, it helped me want to be persistent with code regardless of an error. 
 
Lab 3, was a favorite because I was able to actually understand the differences between using double and int in an argument. This allowed me to properly code and compute part 1 of the lab. We were able to do this by calculating a man and woman's BMR using different equations.
 
Lab 4, was a favorite because I got to apply functions and double arguments. This was also one of the labs I liked because the functions we used were applied to calculate measurements such as cups, teaspoons, ounces, and tablespoons. I found this to be enjoyable because I have trouble doing the unit conversions but the function did all the work for that.
